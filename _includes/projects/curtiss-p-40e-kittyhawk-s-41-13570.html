<p>The P-40E S#41-13570 for Claudio Coltri of from Northern Italy is now ready to fly. Test pilot Frank Parker taxied it around Ardmore last week. The test flying is programmed to start in the next week or so.</p>
<p>The wait is to see if we can get our favourite photographer, Gavin Conroy, across the current pandemic border to record the event. If the border stays, we have a plan B - watch this space.</p>
