<p>Previously one of the Yak 11 ex-Egypt, it was sent to Russia for conversion to a Yak 3 (3 & 11 shared many design features including wing assemblies) Fitted with Allison V1710 because of lack of availability of original Klimov V12. After major structural work was completed in Russia – returned to Duxford in UK where detail work was completed and UKCAA paperwork issued for the work done.</p>
<p>Apart from the Allison, the aircraft is very close to authentic Yak 3 specs, unlike the later “Reproduction” Yak 3s and 9s that has a totally different spec on the wing construction.</p>
<p>Our job was to amalgamate the work done to date and assemble, paint, certify and fly the completed aircraft.</p>
<p>This aircraft is now currently owned and flown by Arthur Dovey of Wanaka, New Zealand.</p>
