<p>The build of this Titan T51 kit is a collaboration between Pioneer Aero and an Australian-based businessman. We are using our years of experience building full size warbirds to complete this aircraft to an exceptionally high standard.</p>
<p>It will be fitted with a 3.5L Honda V6 engine which will endow it with impressive performance for such a small aircraft.</p>
<p>When completed, it will grace the New Zealand skies for a few months before heading to Australia.</p>
