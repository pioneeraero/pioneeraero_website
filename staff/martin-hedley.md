## Chief Engineer

![Martin Hedley]({{ '/assets/img/staff/martin-hedley.jpg' | relative_url }})

Martin began his aviation career straight out of school by joining the RNZAF in June 1994. He served for 7 1/2 years working mostly on the A-4K Skyhawks.

Since leaving the Airforce and joining Pioneer Aero Restorations in December 2001 Martin has completed:

National Certificates in Aeronautical engineering for Aircraft Structures, Power Plant and Aircraft Mechanical. National Diploma in Aeronautical Maintenance and gained his Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licence.

Martin’s time out of work is spent enjoying various activities with his Wife and Sons, playing soccer and completing minor projects around home.

Martin states “the added responsibility of being Chief Engineer is challenging but the buzz of seeing an aircraft fly for the first time makes it all worth it”.
