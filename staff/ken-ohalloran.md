**Engineer (Avionics)**

Ken's father flew Spitfires during WW2 and later Mustangs for the RNZAF as a TAF pilot. Ken's mother was a WAAF U.K. during WW2, so aviation was in the blood.

Ken commenced a 5-year Avionics apprenticeship with Air New Zealand in 1966 and gained Aircraft Maintenance Licenses shortly after completing this. He was part of Line and Heavy maintenance crews on all fleet types within the Air NZ group.

In 1976 Ken was seconded to Malaysian Airlines (MAS) as an avionics licensed engineer for two years working in Kuala Lumpur.

After returning from Malaysia, he was promoted to shift lead hand and in 1999 took up a position of Tech support engineer until leaving in 2012.

Ken then worked as an avionics contract engineer at Airwork holdings before joining Pioneer Aero in Jun 2017.
