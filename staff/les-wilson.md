![Les Wilson]({{ '/assets/img/staff/les-wilson.jpg' | relative_url }})

Les has had a lifetime involvement in aviation, having a father who was WW2 aircrew and an Ag pilot in the 1950s ignited this passion.

On leaving school Les commenced an aircraft engineering apprenticeship with Air New Zealand and was fortunate to be involved with the construction of the first 3 Fletcher turbo-prop ag aircraft and the associated structural testing regime.

Qualified as a LAME and over the years of employment at Air New Zealand gained multiple group 3 engine and group 6 airframe ratings. Les was heavily involved in almost every major aircraft project accomplished by Air New Zealand during his time of employment there. Apart from their own fleet this included the maintenance of the RNZAFâ€™s P3s and C130s Australian Airforce and Chilean Navy's P3s and the Kestrel upgrade of the RNZAF P3 fleet.

Les is a current PPL and maintains his own aircraft, he also is the owner of a classic car having previously built a Lotus 7 replica from scratch.

Les retired from Air New Zealand in 2015 and soon after started at Pioneer Aero.
