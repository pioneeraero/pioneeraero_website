The Pioneer Aero crew of Steve, Marty and Craig have now finished the assembly of and ground run the P39. For them that means they can look forward to heading back this way and a slight drop in temperature. Thanks go to them for a fine job done but also to their families who have been here at home without them, thanks to you all.

All that remains is for the FAA legal side of things to be completed and the aircraft will fly unfortunately the team will be home here by the time that happens.
