The Pioneer Aero crew of [Steve]({{ '/staff/steve-cox' | relative_url }}), [Marty]({{ '/staff/martin-hedley' | relative_url }}) and [Craig]({{ '/staff/craig-cunha' | relative_url }}) have now finished the assembly of and ground run the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}).  
For them, that means they can look forward to heading back this way, and a slight drop in temperature.  
Thanks go to them for a fine job done, but also to their families who have been here at home without them - thanks to you all.

All that remains is for the FAA legal side of things to be completed and the aircraft will fly - unfortunately the team will be home here by the time that happens.
