Wishing you all belated season's compliments.

Back from the summer break and into it, work continues on all of our long-term projects - more on them later. 

The lovely Beech Staggerwing that arrived before Christmas is due for engine runs today and a flight tomorrow, all things going to plan.

Keep watching this space - we have some exciting developments ahead already for 2013.
