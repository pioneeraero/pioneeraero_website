The dust is finally starting to settle from the hangar shift and work continues around the sorting out hangar improvements.

The roof is being painted in sections to improve the look and the amount of light, new clear light panels are being added across the top of the hangar doors and additional lighting is being hung over the main work area at the rear of the hangar.

Work has continued un abated on the P39 and a rash of annual servicings were finished just before Christmas. Garry Rasmussen has dusted off the Bearhawk and wants to make good progress on that this year.

More test flying has happened on on the T51 and once the silly season is over for good that will carry on.

Work is about to start in earnest on the “new P40” and recommence on the “E” fuselage that we have been building as well as this we are planing on having the painting booth back in action at the end of February after its major spruce up.

Plenty of things happening in 2016, looking forward to an exciting year.
