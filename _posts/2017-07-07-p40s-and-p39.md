Work has been progressing steadily with these 3 projects and I have put some new photos up on the project pages. The P39 has all of the new wing fittings now bolted in and the RH wing has been successfully trial fitted, I can safely say it has been bolted to the fuselage for the first time. The fuel tanks are now being made , 12 of the little buggers, these are small rubber bladders connected with tubes.

The Bristol Freighter has now been cleared of Asbestos and deemed safe to work on and in so work will continue getting that ready for sending to the UK. As part of this process we have David Bradley here with us from the UK sorting through containers and attempting to see all of the Freighters still in NZ, today he is at the Wigram Museum.
