I know you should never say never, but I will go out on a limb and say that I don’t think we will ever see three serviceable Strikemasters on the same bit of tarmac in New Zealand again, Let alone three ex-RNZAF ones.

On return from the Tauranga airshow this morning, the [70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) and [62]({{ 'strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}), which are about to head to the US, were parked next to [72]({{ 'strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}), which is staying here, for the final few photos.

It has been a great six years with these aircraft, and we look forward to maintaining our links with 72 as it continues to fly in New Zealand. 

In 1992, when the aircraft disappeared to Australia, I don’t think anyone ever thought there would be a flying Strikemaster in New Zealand again, but thanks to Brett Nicholls, Brian Hall and Charles Davis, we have been fortunate to see them flying at aviation events all around the country.

We will follow the continuing flying on 62 and 70 in the US with interest. A little ironic that another couple of our dated and “clapped out” aircraft are finding a new home in the US being used for defence contracts.
