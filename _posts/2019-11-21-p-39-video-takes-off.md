I have just heard from Allan Udy of the [Historical Aviation Film Unit](https://aviationfilm.com/) that the video he shot at Ardmore on the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) has had over 630,000 views. This is a huge number, and shows people's fascination with this rare aircraft.

For those of you that missed it or need a refresh the link is below.
