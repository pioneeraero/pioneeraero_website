The re-assembly team have been hard at work over the weekend, taking a couple of minutes off here and there to watch the Airshow. As of Monday evening U.S. time, the tail group is on and rigged, both wings are on and both the flaps and the gear are moving up and down. Well done to the crew on the ground there Steve, Martin and Craig.
