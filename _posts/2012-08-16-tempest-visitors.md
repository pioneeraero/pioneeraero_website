A big day for us all on Tuesday with visitors coming in to view the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}). 

Guests of honour were Jack Stafford and his wife Edith. Jack needs no real introduction and we were pleased to be able to re-unite him with the Tempest after last sitting in one in 1946. 

Also present were Jim McCawâ€™s sons, Donald and John, and Ron Peet, who flew P-40s and Corsairs with the RNZAF.
