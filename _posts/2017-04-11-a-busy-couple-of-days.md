Yesterday, we had the pleasure of hosting warbird collector and all round nice guy, Kermit Weeks, on his first visit to Ardmore in over eight years.

And today, to beat the weather (again), we shifted the Bristol Freighter across the airfield and onto our tarmac.  
There was a fair bit of grass tracking involved in this, so even though we havenâ€™t dried out from the last storm, it just had to happen. It went with out a hitch, I am pleased to say.
