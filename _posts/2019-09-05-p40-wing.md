It has been a long while since we have had a complete P40 wing sitting in the hangar, you forget how large they are. Here is the joined wings for P40E S#41-13570 and now the landing gear fit and plumbing are taking place.

The other two P40 projects also continue to make progress.With the leading edges being worked on for the other E model and a start being made on the fuselage for NZ3147.

And as the One Design wing rolls out of the newly refurbished paint booth it is replaced with an RV7.
