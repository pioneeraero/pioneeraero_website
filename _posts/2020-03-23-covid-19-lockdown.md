Yesterday the New Zealand Government made the decision to move our alert status to level three and then level four as of midnight tomorrow.

In line with this Pioneer Aero will be closing down until this alert status is lowered. At this stage we will be closed for a period of one month.

Our thoughts are with those dealing with this virus and with those on the “frontline” . It is a time now more than ever to think of others and stay safe. This whole necessary exercise will be futile if people don’t play the game.

Look forward to seeing you all on the other side.
