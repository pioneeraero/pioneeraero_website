The old engine is now out of Kittyhawk CAG and the new engine is now clearing customs. The engine bearers are being removed and all items forward of the firewall are being given a “freshen up”.

Strikemaster 70 now has new wing bolts fitted to the LH wing and is having the UC rigged . It and Str 72 are having new lower stick fittings manufactured, this is the last of the big ticket items for both aircraft.

The T51 has had the inner UC doors and uplocks fitted.
