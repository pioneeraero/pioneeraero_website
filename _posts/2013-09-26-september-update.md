Coming up to the end of another busy month. Check out the new photos in the Bearhawk, P40-E and Titan pages.

Garry Rasmussen is currently working away on his Bearhawk wings and is making good progress, the fuel system (wing wise) is now pretty much sorted and this morning he has finalised the pitot system from wing root to the head.

Work continues on the P40-E fuselage with the first of the frames getting fitted to the fixture.

The T51 has this month had a set of inner gear doors and modified uplocks fitted and these operate in the same fashion as the originals. This set up for the T51 has been designed and built in New Zealand by Warren Sly.

The two Strikemasters continue to sit in the hangar awaiting the manufacture of a couple of vital parts, which is happening now so the 2 ship is moving closer.

Kittyhawk CAG has had the 100hr annual started and in conjunction with this is having a fresh engine fitted so the prop and current engine will come off next week.
