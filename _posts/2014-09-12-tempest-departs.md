In June 2012, Eric Hertz brought out to Pioneer Aero two bottles of bubbly. The first one was drank to celebrate the arrival of two container loads of parts from France that were hoped in a year or twoâ€™s time would be a flying [Hawker Tempest MkII]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}).

The second unfortunately remains unopened - this was the bottle that was going to be drank to celebrate the aircraft's first post-restoration test flight. This morning, two container loads of parts left our hangar bound for Canada and its new owner. 

It is our hope that sooner rather than later, we can take this now precious bottle to Canada and toast both a first flight and absent friends.
