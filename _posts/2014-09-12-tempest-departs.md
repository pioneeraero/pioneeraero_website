In June 2012 Eric Hertz bought out to Pioneer Aero two bottles of bubbly. The first one was drunk to celebrate the arrival of two container loads of parts from France that it was hoped in a year or twoâ€™s time would be a flying Hawker Tempest MkII.

The second unfortunately remains unopened, this was the bottle that was going to be drunk to celebrate the aircrafts first post restoration test flight. This morning two container loads of parts left our hangar bound for Canada and its new owner. It is our hope that sooner rather than later we can take this now precious bottle to Canada and toast both a first flight and absent friends.
