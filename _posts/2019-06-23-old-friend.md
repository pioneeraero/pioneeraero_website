It is always nice when [old friends]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) come back to visit. Engine run today, so the peace around Ardmore will be shattered - nice to remind the neighbours they live by an airfield. 

Also departing tomorrow is the F27, on itâ€™s way to Aussie which means we get our taxiway back.
