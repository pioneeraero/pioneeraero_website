Before the accident that claimed the lives of Eric and Kathy Hertz it was their dream to restore to flying Tempest MW376. One of the prime motivators for this dream was the opportunity to honour the New Zealanders who flew with 486 Squadron in the Typhoon and Tempest aircraft.

Pioneer Aero is now working with some New Zealand based individuals who are keen to form a syndicate to ensure that the dream that Eric and Kathy had can be bought to reality, here, in New Zealand. To help us spread the word we will be putting advertisements in some of the local aviation magazines, Dave Homewood has also put the news on his excellent site, link below

TV3â€™s Campbell live were also in the hangar yesterday filming for an item on the Tempest that will hopefully air next week.

If you or anyone you know has interest in a possible syndicate please contact <paul@pioneeraero.co.nz> 09 296 8913.
