Every now and then, we get asked if someone can come in, look around and take photos. We are generally more than happy for this to happen. 

Every now and then, we even get some shots that we think are noteworthy - this is the case here.

Attached are some photos taken by young photographer student Olivier Longley. These are just a small selection of what he took. Great shots, Olivier - we wish you well for the future.
