This great photo taken By Gavin Conroy before the second test flight of Jerry Yagens P39 on Wednesday is of test pilot Frank Parker and the current Pioneer Aero staff. In essence this is a photo of the people that made this happen, while acknowledging the contribution of other firms and individuals these are the people that day in day out worked through the complexities of the task and made it happen.

Thanks to you all.
