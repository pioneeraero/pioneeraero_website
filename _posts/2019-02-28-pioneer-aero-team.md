This great photo, taken By Gavin Conroy before the second test flight of Jerry Yagen's [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) on Wednesday, is of test pilot Frank Parker and the [current Pioneer Aero staff]({{ '/staff/' | relative_url }}).

In essence, this is a photo of the people who made this happen. While acknowledging the contribution of other firms and individuals, these are the people who, day in and day out, worked through the complexities of the task and made it happen.

Thanks to you all.
