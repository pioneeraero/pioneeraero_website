Congratulations to Brian and Kevin in Christchurch. Brianâ€™s ex-Saudi Strikemaster yesterday received the tick in the box from NZCAA to allow it to start its test flight program. Test flying will be done by Dave Brown, and once he is finished in Christchurch, we should have [72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) ready for him up here.

There is an outside chance that 72 may make a static-only appearance at this weekend's D-Day Open Day.
