You know it is the “Silly season” starting when you have the Christmas functions in fully swing and group visits through the hangar. Last weekend it was a group from TACCOC and this weekend we are proud to show the members of the WONZ Forum around, great excuse for a major clean up.

The P39 is progressing well and we are waiting delivery of the fuel bag tanks so we can start the installation of these. Work continues with the electrics (a few more wires than a P40 with electric gear and flaps) tubing is also being bent as we speak for the coolant and oil plumbing. All of the fabric covering for this aircraft has now been completed.

Work continues on the P40’s with some solid progress on both airframes and just in time for Christmas some bling has been added to the bearhawk
