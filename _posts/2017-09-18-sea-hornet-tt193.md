The announcement in Classic Wings Downunder has caused quite a stir.  
It seems there are a lot of people out there who are as excited as us about this.  
We have already had a lot of questions asked about all manner of details, so hopefully my bullet points below will answer most of these.

* The project is currently owned by Pioneer Aero.
* It is located at our hangar at Ardmore, Auckland, New Zealand, and at this point is not available for public viewing.
* Yes, the intention is to return it to flight.
* It is a DH.103 Sea Hornet - it is not a Mosquito.
* There is still a lot of detail to be worked through so we have no firm idea of time frames at this stage.
* Yes, we are a little crazy.

It is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge and thank the following people:  
Corin McCrae, Aerowood  
Mr. Reg Field  
David Collins, Project Hornet, UK  
Hugh Jones, UK
