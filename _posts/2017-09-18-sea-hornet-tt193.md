The announcement in Classic Wings Downunder has caused quite a stir it seems there are a lot of people out there who are as excited as us about this. We have already had a lot of questions asked about all manner of details so hopefully my bullet points below will answer most of these.

The project is currently owned by Pioneer Aero.

It is located at our hangar at Ardmore, Auckland New Zealand and at this point is not available for public viewing.

Yes the intention is to return it to flight.

It is a DH 103 Sea Hornet, it is not a Mosquito

There is still a lot of detail to be worked through so we have no firm idea of time frames at this stage.

Yes we are a little crazy.

It is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge and thank the following people.

Corin McCrae , Aerowood.

Mr Reg Field.

David Collins, Project Hornet. U.K.

Hugh Jones U.K.
