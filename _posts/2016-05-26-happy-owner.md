A gloomy day at Ardmore couldnâ€™t dampen the smile on David Lanes face as he taxied around the airfield and then for the first time got to see his aircraft fly. A few final touches, mainly cosmetic and then it is decision time, how long does it stay in New Zealand? and how much flying do I do in it here? and how do I get it to Australia?
