A gloomy day at Ardmore couldnâ€™t dampen the smile on David Lane's face as he taxied around the airfield, and then for the first time, got to see his aircraft fly. 

A few final touches, mainly cosmetic, and then it is decision time:  
How long does it stay in New Zealand?  
How much flying do I do in it here?  
How do I get it to Australia?
