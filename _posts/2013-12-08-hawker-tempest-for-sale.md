The Tempest project is now for sale on the “world market”. A huge thank you to those people who have contacted us and offered support, in all sorts of ways, to restore and keep the project here in New Zealand but as we have not reached the threshold needed, the decision has been made to actively market it overseas.

All is not lost - we are still hopeful that we will see this magnificent aircraft fly in New Zealand. As you can imagine, we are very keen to continue the rebuild to fly.

It is being marketed by [Platinum Fighter Sales](https://www.platinumfighters.com/#!tempest/c4nw). 
John and Simon have a great inventory of aircraft for sale and we think the Tempest project fits nicely in there.
