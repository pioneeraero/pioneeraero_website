The culmination of a lot of prep work came today when the wings were lifted off the Bristol Freighter and transported across the airfield to the Pioneer Aero tarmac.

This is the first phase of what will be a rather large “pack up” before the aircraft leaves New Zealand and heads back to Bristol.

It is hoped that the fuselage can now be towed across the field but we are waiting for the grass to dry a little first.
