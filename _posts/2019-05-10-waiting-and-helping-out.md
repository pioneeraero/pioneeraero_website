A delay at the border for the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) container has meant that the team from Pioneer Aero have arrived in Virginia minus aircraft.  
While they are waiting, they have been filling in their time by assisting the team at the [Military Aviation Museum](https://militaryaviationmuseum.org/) to prepare their inventory in preparation for next weekend's airshow.

To us back here in New Zealand, it just looks like they have been having way too much fun.

Not to mention the little side trip on the way there to visit the [Udvar-Hazy Center](https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/udvar-hazy-center).
