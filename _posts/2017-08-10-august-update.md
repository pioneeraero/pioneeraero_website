Work carries on with the P39, P40’s and also the dismantling and preparing of the Bristol Freighter for it’s trip to the UK. The P39 has had both of it’s wings trial fitted which was a huge relief to the team who had spent a lot of hours replacing and reaming wing fittings, with the wings on we are reminded that this is a small aeroplane only 36 ft wingspan.

Great progress has been made on one P40 with remedial work being carried out on both wings and the second of the main U/C fairings well on the way, also work on the 2 seat conversion happening as well. Work continues at a slower pace on the other P40 but it is looking good.

With Murray Ransfield and Bruce Ricketts (both ex RNZAF) leading the charge and loving every minute of it the Freighter has had its UC and centre section removed and is now sitting on it’s belly, we are now getting frames made for all of the items to be shipped on. While this has been happening David Bradley from the Bristol Aero Collection Trust has been out from the UK sorting out the other 1000’s of pieces to head in that direction. David as seen in the photo below was missing the English summer so did his best to replicate it.
