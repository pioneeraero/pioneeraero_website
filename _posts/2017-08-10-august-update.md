Work carries on with the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}), P-40s, and also the dismantling and preparing of the Bristol Freighter for its trip to the UK.  
The P-39 has had both of its wings trial fitted, which was a huge relief to the team who had spent a lot of hours replacing and reaming wing fittings.  
With the wings on, we are reminded that this is a small aeroplane, only 36ft wingspan.

Great progress has been made on one P-40, with remedial work being carried out on both wings, and the second of the main U/C fairings well on the way. Also, work on the 2-seat conversion happening as well.  
Work continues at a slower pace on the other P-40 but it is looking good.

With Murray Ransfield and Bruce Ricketts (both ex-RNZAF) leading the charge, and loving every minute of it, the Freighter has had its UC and centre section removed and is now sitting on its belly.  
We are now getting frames made for all of the items to be shipped on.

While this has been happening, David Bradley from the Bristol Aero Collection Trust has been out from the UK, sorting out the other thousands of pieces to head in that direction.  
David, as seen in the photo below, was missing the English summer, so did his best to replicate it.
