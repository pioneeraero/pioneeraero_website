With the P39 only days away from it’s new home and the re-assembly team ready to leave early next week the rest of the hangar is now changing shape. The wing jigs have been erected and building P40 wings now is starting in earnest with at least 2 sets needed. To accommodate this the P40-E has been moved into the “next out the door” position.

Also now starting is the fuselage for NZ3147 we hope you are looking forward to the progress on this, on completion it will be in it’s as flown in 1944 paint scheme.
