With the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) only days away from its new home and the reassembly team ready to leave early next week, the rest of the hangar is now changing shape. 

The wing jigs have been erected and building P-40 wings now is starting in earnest, with at least two sets needed. To accommodate this, the P-40E has been moved into the “next out the door” position.

Also now starting is the fuselage for [NZ3147]({{ '/projects/curtiss-p-40n-1-kittyhawk-nz3147' | relative_url }}). We hope you are looking forward to the progress on this.  
On completion, it will be in its as-flown-in-1944 paint scheme.
