A bit of a gloomy day here this morning for the Strikemasters x 2 engine runs. This is to keep the oil were it should be seeing they havent been flown for coming up to a month and will save having to prime the oil system next start, not the nicest job in the world.

Compare this to the bright sunshine for the T28 run on Saturday, bit warmer today though.
