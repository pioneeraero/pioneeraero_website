A bit of a gloomy day here this morning for the [two]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) [Strikemasters']({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) engine runs. 

This is to keep the oil where it should be, seeing they haven't been flown for coming up to a month, and will save having to prime the oil system next start - not the nicest job in the world.

Compare this to the bright sunshine for the [T28]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}) run on Saturday, bit warmer today though.
