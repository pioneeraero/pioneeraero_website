Just as a bit of fun (although not all fun), we decided to have a cooking competition.  
The rules were pretty clear: anything that could be cooked in the small muffin tins we provided, and no packet mixes. 

So every Wednesday for the past couple of months, we have been treated to some mouth-watering delicacies.  
I am very happy to say: no real failures, certainly not in the taste department.

The winner, as judged by his peers, was [Jason Harris]({{ '/staff/jason-harris' | relative_url }}) with his smoked fish pies wrapped in bacon, followed closely by [Martyâ€™s]({{ '/staff/martin-hedley' | relative_url }}) sticky date puddings with butterscotch sauce.

Not aviation-related, I know, but a bit of fun.
