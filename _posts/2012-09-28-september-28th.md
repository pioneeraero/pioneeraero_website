We would like to congratulate all involved in the return of Mosquito KA114 to the air here at Ardmore. It was great to see it become airbourne yesterday after following the work for so many years, and we are all looking forward to it flying tomorrow with several other aircraft of the same era.

Also finished this week was the static (for now) Macchi which will now sit in the [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) hangar next to the A4.
