A bit late on this one, but for those of you who donâ€™t know, Brian Hall's [T28]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}) had a successful first flight yesterday with Dave Brown at the helm.  
This is 16 years since this aircraft last flew, and 67 years to the day that the T28 prototype took to the sky.
