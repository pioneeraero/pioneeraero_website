Yesterday, we were proud to deliver a complete rear wing to Andrew Higgins to fit to the Lola T400 he will be driving in this year's New Zealand F5000 Tasman Cup Revival Series. 

The old wing was damaged beyond repair so, using the old wing and period photos, Pioneer Aero built an original spec delta rear wing. We wish Andrew well in this year's series, and will be watching with interest when he takes it to the Aussies in the first two rounds of their series, in Sydney in late August and Melbourne in early September.
