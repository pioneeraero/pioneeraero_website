At the very successful Airshow held at Gisborne last Saturday Pioneer Aero was proud to announce the start of another P40 Restoration. NZ 3147 a P40N-1 with a very interesting New Zealand history has been sold to an Auckland based businessman and work on this is scheduled to start later this year.

As well as being flown up to Guadalcanal and operated in and around the Solomon Islands it was operated at Gisborne. While at Gisborne in 1944 it was involved in an incident the saw NZ3147 flown by a Flying Officer “shoot down” the Squadron CO. fortunately the damage was confined to the other aircraft and a few reputations. Initial research indicates there were some very well known people with this serial in their logbooks.
