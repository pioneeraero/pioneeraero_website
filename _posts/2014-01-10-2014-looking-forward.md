Almost every one is now back at work after a well-earned break. I have posted some more photos of the p40 E and you will see with the addition of some fuselage skins there is very good visual progress, work will continue on this and we may as the year moves on start on other components for this aircraft.

With about 6 hours on the new engine since fitment to CAG it has had the cowls off to give it the once over, all is good. Hopefully next time you see her flying the drop tank will be back in place on the centre rack.

Work also continues on the T51 which is now only months from flying, more photos on it soon, Strikemaster 72, the Bearhawk wings, Spitfire items and Mosquito fuel tanks.

We also have a couple of other exciting things on the horizon so keep looking for a couple of major announcements that will come this year.

I hope 2014 will be an exciting one both for us and those that follow our blog/website/Facebook page.

Cheers.
