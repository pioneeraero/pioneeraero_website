On Friday we hosted all of the owners of New Zealandâ€™s flying Strikemaster Jet fleet.

And at 8.00am Monday morning the latest acquisition NZ6362 hit the ground at Ardmore. Hopefully by the end of the day i will be able to post a photo of the 3 ex RNZAF jets together.

NZCAA due here on Wednesday to certify NZ6372, we move ever closer to a multi Strikemaster photo shoot.
