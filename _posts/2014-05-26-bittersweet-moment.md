It is always a good feeling to be able to send someone thier aircraft, but we all had mixed feelings about this pack up.

Going into the box for it’s trip to Canada was the lovely Beech Staggerwing formerly owned by Eric Hertz. Eric purchased the aircraft in the US and it was restored there before heading to Oshkosh 2012 were it picked up a bronze “Lindy” for champion WWII era aircraft and then on to New Zealand. It has been a welcome edition to the classic aircraft scene here for the last couple of years but now it is time for it to move on.

We hope it is appreciated as much in the Canadian skies as it was here.
