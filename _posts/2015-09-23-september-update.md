It has been a busy month - the annual servicing on [Strikemaster 62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) has been completed and the annual on CAG is almost done. 

Both of these have been carried out in the back of the [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) main hangar, which has added a dynamic element to what has largely been a storage shed. 

We have had a lot of positive comments on this, and there have certainly been a large amount of photos taken. People have been fascinated seeing the aircraft with their clothes off.

Also arriving in the hangar last week was [P-40E 41-13570]({{ '/projects/curtiss-p-40e-kittyhawk-s-41-13570' | relative_url }}) which has come in from the USA. This project will be rebuilt to fly with a rear seat and dual controls.

Photos have been added to the [current maintanence]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}) and P-40 project.
