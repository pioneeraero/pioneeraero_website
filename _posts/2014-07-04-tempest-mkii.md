Pioneer Aeroâ€™s rollercoaster ride with the Tempest MkII is about to come to an end. In the last 2 years this project has given us for various reasons hope, jubilation and despair.

The project has now been sold off shore and in the next month or so we should be packing it up and dispatching it. We are buoyed by the fact it is going to a new owner who has both the will and capability to get the aircraft back in the air.
