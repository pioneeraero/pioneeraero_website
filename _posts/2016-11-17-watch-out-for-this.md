After undergoing some repairs, and a full strip and repaint, [Strikemaster 72 (ZK-BAC)]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) is almost ready to return to the air.

The aircraft has been repainted back to the genuine RNZAF colour scheme, which hopefully will please the purists out there.

Some additional decals are still to be added but she is looking smart.
