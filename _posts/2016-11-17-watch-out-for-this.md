After undergoing some repairs and a full strip and repaint Strikemaster 72 (ZK-BAC) is almost ready to return to the air.

The aircraft has been repainted back to the genuine RNZAF colour scheme which hopefully will please the puristâ€™s out there, some additional decals are still to be added but she is looking smart.
