The best laid plans! We had intended to carry out the annual servicing on [Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) in [New Zealand Warbirds'](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) hangar starting early September.

However, [62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) had the last say, and last week decided to drop all of the fluid out of its LH main leg, so in conjunction with sorting this problem, the annual on 62 has also started. 

A different aircraft and a couple of weeks early but something dynamic happening in the Warbirds hangar for the next week or so in the Jet corner.
