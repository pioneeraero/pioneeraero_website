Behind this rather uninspiring blank canvas from the middle of December sits the new premise of Pioneer Aero Ltd. 

Yes, we are relocating to 540 Corsair Lane, Ardmore Airfield, and as from the 15th of December, we will be up and running at the new address.

We are hoping that in a few months time, we will be saying that was a good move because, at the moment, we are in the middle of cleaning, painting, sorting, and still to come, shifting. 

We are starting to wonder about our sanity. Others wonder about that a lot, I have been told!
