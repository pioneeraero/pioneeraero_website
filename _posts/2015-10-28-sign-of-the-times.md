Behind this rather uninspiring blank canvas from the middle of December sits the new premise of Pioneer Aero ltd. Yes we are relocating to 540 Corsair Lane Ardmore Airfield and as from the 15th of December we will be up and running at the new address.

We are hoping that in a few months time we will be saying that was a good move because at the moment we are in the middle of cleaning, painting, sorting and still to come shifting and are starting to wonder about our sanity. Others wonder about that a lot I have been told!
