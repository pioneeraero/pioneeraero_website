We finished off October with the first engine run on the Zenair 801 taking place at 16.00 on Friday. All went well there and we now await a visit from CAA next week and then hopefully she is in the air.

Monday morning and as the heavens opened MAF arrived to inspect the new arrival which as you can see is only a quick paint job away from flight.
