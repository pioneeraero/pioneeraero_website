The P40E tailplane is now finished, check out the new photo of it with fin attached.

The first of the Tempest wings is now suspended in the jig with the final mountings just being finalised now. Work has also started on the Tempest forward fuselage with separation of the forward section frame from the monocoque scheduled to happen next week.

The NZ Warbirds Macchi is now 90% assembled (we all know what that means) and looking good in its spot next to the A4K.

On Saturday we were pleased to host members of the Z Club of New Zealand, nice to see the quality Japanese vehicles outnumbering the European rubbish.
