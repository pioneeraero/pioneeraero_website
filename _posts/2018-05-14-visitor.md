Unfortunately, hangar space is a little short here at Ardmore, so we are having to bed our visitor down outside.  
For those of you who miss the [Bluntyâ€™s]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) flying around Auckland, make sure you get to the [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) open Day on the 3rd of June and catch this one before it heads south.
