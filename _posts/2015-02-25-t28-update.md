Airspray Ardmore are now well into the painting on the [T28]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}), and as you can see from the pictures attached, it is not going to be hard to spot once it is rolled out. 

The paint scheme should make it a stand out in any company and I am in no doubt it will be a popular subject for the countryâ€™s aviation photographers.
