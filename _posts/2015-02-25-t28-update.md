Airspray Ardmore are now well into the painting on the T28 and as you can see from the pictures attached it is not going to be hard to spot once it is rolled out. The paint scheme should make it a stand out in any company and I am in no doubt it will be a popular subject for the countryâ€™s aviation photographers.
