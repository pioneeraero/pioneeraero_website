The mating of the wings on the P-40E has opened up the next list of tasks to be completed. Work has now started on the wing fillet fairings, and continues on the original upper engine cowl and trunking, the rear seat conversion, and the dummy gun fitment, to mention just a few.

Jason has been busy in the paint shop, finishing the last little pieces for Lloyd Morris’s stunning RV7, and painting the fuselage, flight controls and fairings for David Wilkinson’s DR-107. Next job - a visiting warbird!
