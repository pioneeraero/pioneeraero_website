Everynow and then you come across something that makes you stop and think With the new P40 project was a set of original rubber fuel tanks clad in leather as you can see from the attached photos these are in remarkable condition. Interesting also to note the date.

Yesterday after a protracted test flight schedule Dave Brown finally signed off on Strikemaster 62 pictured are Martin Hedley (Cheif Engineer) Brett Nicholls (Aircrft Owner) Allen House and Craig Cuhna, engineers. Keep your eyes open for something special at the next New Zealand Warbirds open day at the end of November. The last few months have been particularly frustrating with us having great weather when Dave hasnâ€™t been here and and typical winters days when he has been. This is now all behind us and 2 ships maybecome a regular sight around Ardmore.
