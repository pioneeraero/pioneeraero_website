Every now and then, you come across something that makes you stop and think. With the new P-40 project was a set of original rubber fuel tanks clad in leather. As you can see from the attached photos, these are in remarkable condition. Interesting also to note the date.

Yesterday, after a protracted test flight schedule, Dave Brown finally signed off on [Strikemaster 62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}).

Pictured are [Martin Hedley]({{ '/staff/martin-hedley' | relative_url }}) (chief engineer), Brett Nicholls (aircraft owner), [Allen House]({{ '/staff/allen-house' | relative_url }}) and [Craig Cunha]({{ '/staff/craig-cunha' | relative_url }}) (engineers). 

Keep your eyes open for something special at the next [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) open day at the end of November. 

The last few months have been particularly frustrating, with us having great weather when Dave hasnâ€™t been here, and typical winters days when he has been. This is now all behind us, and two ships may become a regular sight around Ardmore.
