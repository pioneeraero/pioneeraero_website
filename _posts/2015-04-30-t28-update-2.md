For all you followers of the T28 and there are a good many; Yesterday the brakes were bled and engine run number two was carried out so I am pleased to say that we have a fine clear day to taxi her round on the Ardmore tarmac, this afternoon we will move the aircraft from the Pioneer Aero hangar to New Zealand Warbirds, under her own steam.
