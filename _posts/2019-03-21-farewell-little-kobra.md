The [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) has now finished test flying, been granted a non-terminating C of A, and is now being packed and containerised for its trip to the [Military Aviation Museum](https://militaryaviationmuseum.org/) in Virginia, USA.  
All this has happened this week!

While we are sad to see it go, we are excited at the prospect of it flying in Virginia in the near future.
