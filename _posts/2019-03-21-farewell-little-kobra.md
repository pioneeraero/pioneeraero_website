The P39 has now finished test flying, been granted a non terminating C of A and is now being packed and containerised for itâ€™s trip to the Military Aviation Museum in Virginia U.S.A. All this has happened this week!

While we are sad to see it go we are excited at the prospect of it flying in Virginia in the near future.
