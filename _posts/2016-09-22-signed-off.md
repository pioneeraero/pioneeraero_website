The day has come: yesterday, Gary Leach from NZCAA issued the C of A so the mighty R2000-powered [T28]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}) can begin test flying. Congratulations to Brian Hall and Kevin Langford.

Pioneer Aero was pleased to be associated with this return to flight, and provide assistance as and when required.

Now the combination of intrepid aviator and weather gods need to align to start the test flight program.
