Last week it was out with the old engine and this week it is in with the new. Pity back in the day we didnâ€™t have magicians with remote-controlled Hiabs and had to make do with the Galleon or pity help us Coles crane. I do recall an engine sitting outside AMS at Ohakea overnight slung underneath a crane which had broken down.
