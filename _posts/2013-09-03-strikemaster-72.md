Last week, it was out with the old engine, and this week, it is in with the new. 

Pity back in the day, we didnâ€™t have magicians with remote-controlled HIABs and had to make do with the Galion or, pity help us, Coles crane. 

I do recall an engine sitting outside AMS at Ohakea overnight slung underneath a crane which had broken down.
