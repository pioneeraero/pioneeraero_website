A big thanks to Brett Nicholls for the new artwork that is now hanging in our foyer, for those of you that want to see these 2 aircraft “in the flesh” don’t forget the New Zealand Warbird Open Day this Sunday.

More photos will be added to the website of the new projects as we get things sorted, keep your eyes open.
