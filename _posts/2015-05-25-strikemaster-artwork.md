A big thanks to Brett Nicholls for the new artwork that is now hanging in our foyer. 

For those of you who want to see these two aircraft “in the flesh”, don’t forget the [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) Open Day this Sunday.

More photos will be added to the website of the [new projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}) as we get things sorted - keep your eyes open.
