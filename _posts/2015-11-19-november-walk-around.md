It has been a while since the last post and things have moved on. Progress is ongoing preparing the “new” hangar for occupation, we move in less than a month.

Meanwhile progress continues on P40’s the P39 and as you can see from the photos the T51 is now finished and is awaiting NZCAA inspection next Friday.

It all looks a bit crammed in and this is something we hope to recitfy when we shift next month, but all of you that have shifted out of a shed that you have had for sometime will know how we are feeling at the moment.
