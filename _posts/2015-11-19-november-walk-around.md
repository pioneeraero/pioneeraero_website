It has been a while since the [last post]({{ '/news/2015/10/28/sign-of-the-times/' | relative_url }}), and things have moved on. Progress is ongoing, preparing the “new” hangar for occupation - we move in less than a month.

Meanwhile, progress continues on P-40s, the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}), and as you can see from the photos, the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) is now finished and is awaiting NZCAA inspection next Friday.

It all looks a bit crammed in and this is something we hope to recitfy when we shift next month, but all of you that have shifted out of a shed that you have had for sometime will know how we are feeling at the moment.
