[Strikemaster 62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) is now sitting at the wharf in Perth and we expect to see it here at Ardmore mid-March. 

Other than the red backs, Steve was most impressed with the aircraft. It has flown very few hours since it left NZ over 20 years ago, and is something of a time capsule, even still having the old “horseshoe” parachutes fitted. 

Ex-Blunty types can look at the newly added photos on the project page and it will bring it all back.

[Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) is now finished and awaiting NZCAA inspection prior to Dave Brown carrying out the test flights.

[Strikemaster 70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) is heading South mid-next week to spend a hectic few days operating out of Wanaka. Joining it on this southern safari is the P-51 Mustang ZK-TAF.
