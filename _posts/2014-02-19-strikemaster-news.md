Strikemaster 62 in now sitting at the wharf in Perth and we expect to see in here at Ardmore mid March. Other than the red backs Steve was most impressed with the aircraft, it has flown very few hours since it left NZ over 20 years ago and is something of a time capsule even still having the old “horseshoe” parachutes fitted. Ex Blunty types can look at the newly added photos on the project page and it will bring it all back.

Strikemaster 72 is now finished and awaiting NZCAA inspection prior to Dave Brown carrying out the test flights.

Strikemaster 70 is heading South mid next week to spend a hectic few days operating out of Wanaka, joining it on this southern safari is the P51 Mustang ZK-TAF.
