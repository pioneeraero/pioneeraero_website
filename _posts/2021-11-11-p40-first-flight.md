With Frank Parker at the controls on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month ZK-MOM lifted off the ground at Ardmore for it’s first flight in almost 80 years. Thanks go to all those that made this happen, over the course of the restoration both local, national and international firms and individuals were involved in making this come to fruition.

Thanks especially to the proud owner Claudio Coltri to whom has watched this happen from afar. And special thanks to the team hare at Pioneer Aero who have again proved that if anybody can a “Kiwi” can.
