Since we shifted in to the hangar in December, we have been continuing to develop and improve the facilities.  
This work has involved general clean-up, painting of floors and areas of the roof (this is still ongoing), additional Clearlite panels, a new front entrance door, and additional lighting.

We still have a long way to go, but to this point, are happy with what has been achieved.

Below are some photos taken from around the hangar - how many airframes or parts thereof can you see?
