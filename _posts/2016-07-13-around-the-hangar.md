Since we shifted in to the Hangar in December we have been continuing to develop and improve the facilities. This work has involved the general clean up, painting of floors and areas of the roof (this is still ongoing) additional clear-lite panels, a new front entrance door and additional lighting.

We still have a long way to go but to this point are happy with what has been achieved.

Below are some photos taken from around the hangar, how many airframes or parts there of can you see?
