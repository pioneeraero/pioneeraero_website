Work has started in earnest on the P-40E fuselage with a start made on assembling the firewall and fuselage frames, photos to come shortly.

On his return from Australia, were he has been packing up [Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}), Steve will begin repair and manufacture of the fuel tanks for Mosquito number 2, he has gotten over the first set!

Work continues on the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) with the wing panels now just on done and the radiator going in.

We are also fabricating items to go to Australia for Ross Pay's Spitfire.

Unfortunately, the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}) project has been temporarily stored - more news on this when it comes to hand.
