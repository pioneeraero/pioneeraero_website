Another day waiting for the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) to turn up, and yet another type of aircraft to help out with.  
[Steve]({{ '/staff/steve-cox' | relative_url }}), [Marty]({{ '/staff/martin-hedley' | relative_url }}) and [Craig]({{ '/staff/craig-cunha' | relative_url }}) helping out the crew from the [Military Aviation Museum](https://militaryaviationmuseum.org/) assemble a Fiesler Storch for the upcoming airshow.  
Still having a little too much fun, it looks like from here.
