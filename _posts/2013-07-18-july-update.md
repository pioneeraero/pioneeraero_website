Assembly on [Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) has stalled momentarily while we await the arrival of parts and also carry out the annual on [Strikemaster 70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}). As well as the annual, 70 has had the wings removed and all of the NDT inspections carried out. I am pleased to say no defects were found. 

Staying with the Strikemaster theme, I have just spoken to Brian Hall from Christchurch who tells me that ZK-VPR has completed its test flying in the very capable hands of Dave Brown, and a non-terminating CA of A is now being applied for. Pioneer Aero is pleased to have been associated with this aircraft in both an advisory and hands-on capacity since its arrival in New Zealand.

We also continue to assist in the rebuild to flying of [Ross Payâ€™s Australian-based Spitfire](https://paysspitfire.blogspot.com).

The other projects in the shop all continue to make progress: the Suzuki-powered [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}), the as yet unpowered [Bearhawk]({{ '/projects/bearhawk' | relative_url }}), and the P-40 fuselage - more about these shortly.
