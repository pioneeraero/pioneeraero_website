To the list of non-aeronautical items, we now add an H1 Hummer. William has riveted the rear LH quarter back on after a small issue with a wheel departing.

Steve and Paul had a couple of days in Nelson visiting friends, clients and suppliers. We got to see the mighty Sabre engine, which is now domiciled in the WOW museum. 

We also visited Bill Reid and were privileged to see his Anson fly once again, and also view his father's log book and photo album from his time on 486 Sqn.
