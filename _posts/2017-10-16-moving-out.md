It finally happened last week Bristol Freighter NZ5911 was uplifted and moved off our tarmac to the Ports of Auckland to begin it’s journey back to Filton. This was the end of what has been a rather large logistical exercise with the container carrying the engines, props and other ancillary parts having left early last month.

This aircraft when restored will move into the museum at Filton which is having it’s grand opening today, this museum acknowledges the important role that the Bristol Aircraft Company has played in British aviation. We wish them well for the opening and the future.
