Just a quick one to say I have added more photos to the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}), [Bearhawk]({{ '/projects/bearhawk' | relative_url }}) and [Titan]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) pages, but the big news is that the C-Type has had a quantum leap forward.

![New paint]({{ '/assets/img/news/2012/11/Jag.jpg' | relative_url }})

There are also more photos and detail added to the P-40E project and the [For Sale]({{ '/sale/' | relative_url }}) page.
