It has been a busy week with work just about at an end on the P40-E tailplane. Work has continued on the T51 build and the setting up of the fixtures for the rebuild of the Tempest MkII. We have also been assisting New Zealand Warbirds with the assembly of their Macchi 339c which will be displayed in their hangar next to Shyhawk 09.
