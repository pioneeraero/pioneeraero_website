It has been a busy week with work just about at an end on the P-40E tailplane. 

Work has continued on the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) build and the setting up of the fixtures for the rebuild of the [Tempest MkII]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}). 

We have also been assisting New Zealand Warbirds with the assembly of their Macchi 339c which will be displayed in their hangar next to Shyhawk 09.
