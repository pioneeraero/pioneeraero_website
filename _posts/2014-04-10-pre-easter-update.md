Strikemaster 72 has now completed 2 test flights the second one which was curtailed because of weather, it is now sitting in the hangar awaiting Dave Browns return from HK. Hopefully the weather will play the game on Tuesday when the next flight is scheduled .

Strikemaster 62 is making steady progress towards looking like a proper Jet, the wings are being offered up now and the bushes reamed before Tony from CAMS make us new wing bolts, the old ones were just outside the service limits.

Kittyhawk CAG has had a post engine fit going over with a couple of minor oil leaks being rectified it is now all set to again grace the skys at the Wanaka Airshow.

The T28 after several false starts with incorrect parts is now largely back together having had the elevator and rudder hinges replaced and several areas of corrosion on the flight controls dealt to. Typical a week before Wanaka to have something “captured” in the shed.
