[Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) has now completed two test flights, the second of which was curtailed because of weather. It is now sitting in the hangar awaiting Dave Brown's return from HK. Hopefully the weather will play the game on Tuesday when the next flight is scheduled.

[Strikemaster 62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) is making steady progress towards looking like a proper jet. The wings are being offered up now and the bushes reamed, before Tony from C.A.M.S. makes us new wing bolts - the old ones were just outside the service limits.

Kittyhawk CAG has had a post-engine fit going-over. With a couple of minor oil leaks being rectified, it is now all set to again grace the skys at the [Wanaka airshow](https://www.warbirdsoverwanaka.com/).

The [T28]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}), after several false starts with incorrect parts, is now largely back together, having had the elevator and rudder hinges replaced, and dealt to several areas of corrosion on the flight controls. 

Typical, a week before Wanaka, to have something “captured” in the shed.
