Last week, we picked up this intriguing Bleriot replica. All complete except for the wings (there are plans for those). 

A quick kick of the tyres and check of the fluids before kicking it into life and taxing it around the apron. 

After over 4 years of inactivity it started well and ran like the proverbial “Swiss watch”.

Some here got into theme just a little too much for comfort.
