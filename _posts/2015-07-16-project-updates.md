Both the [Titan T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) and also the [T28 Trojan]({{ '/projects/north-american-t28-trojan' | relative_url }}) have made great strides towards first flights.

The T51 has now had its cowlings, all fairings and doors completed, and the canopy is now being finished. We are expecting it will move into the paintshop next week. 

Paperwork has been submitted to CAA so things are getting close - look out for this neat little aircraft at a town near you this summer.

The T28 is now domiciled in the [New Zealand Warbirds](https://nzwarbirds.org.nz/) #2 hangar, and now only needs the engine side of the 100hr annual and high power runs before CAA inspection.
