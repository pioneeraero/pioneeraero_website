It has been a long while since we have had a complete P-40 wing sitting in the hangar - you forget how large they are. Here is the joined wings for [P-40E S#41-13570]({{ '/projects/curtiss-p-40e-kittyhawk-s-41-13570' | relative_url }}), and now the landing gear fit and plumbing are taking place.

The other two P-40 projects also continue to make progress, with the leading edges being worked on for the other E model, and a start being made on the fuselage for [NZ3147]({{ '/projects/curtiss-p-40n-1-kittyhawk-nz3147' | relative_url }}).

And as the One Design wing rolls out of the newly refurbished paint booth, it is replaced with an RV7.
