It has been a long while since we have had a complete P-40 wing sitting in the hangar, you forget how large they are. Here is the joined wings for P-40E S#41-13570 and now the landing gear fit and plumbing are taking place.

The other two P-40 projects also continue to make progress.With the leading edges being worked on for the other E model and a start being made on the fuselage for NZ3147.

And as the One Design wing rolls out of the newly refurbished paint booth it is replaced with an RV7.
