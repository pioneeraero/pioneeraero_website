[Strikemaster 62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) now has its wings fitted with new bolts (a big thanks to Tony from C.A.M.S.) and is back on the ground on its wheels. Hopefully early next week, we will be running the engine, and then be carrying on with the work required to get her certified.

Work has started disassembling the Staggerwing, which is heading to a new home in Canada. It should be going into a container in about two weeks from today.

Work continues on the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) with the fuselage and wing now having been mated for the final time - engine and prop on shortly.

Fuel tanks for both Mosquito and Spitfire, the P-40 fuselage, the [Bearhawk]({{ '/projects/bearhawk' | relative_url }}), and a couple of other smaller projects mean we are all keeping busy.

End of the month, we are also expecting a new arrival from Austria - not a warbird is the only clue I will give.
