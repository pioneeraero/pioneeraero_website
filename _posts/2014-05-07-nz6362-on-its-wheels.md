Strikemaster 6362 now has it’s wings fitted with new bolts (A big thanks to Tony from C.A.M.S.) and is back on the ground on it’s wheels. Hopefully early next week we will be runing the engine and then be carrying on with the work required to get her certified.

Work has started dis-assembling the Staggerwing which is heading to a new home in Canada, it should be going into a container in about 2 weeks from today.

Work continues on the T51 with the fuselage and wing now having been mated for the final time, engine and prop on shortly.

Fuel tanks both Mosquito and Spitfire, the P40 fuselage, the Bearhawk and a couple of other smaller projects mean we are all keeping busy.

End of the month we are also expecting a new arrival from Austria, not a warbird is the only clue I will give.
