It has been a big day today with a low-power engine run on P-40 CAG post-engine change, and currently high powers happening on [Strikemaster 70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) post-100hr annual and repairs.

Marty now has about three days worth of paperwork to do tomorrow and then it will be all go.

The Strikemaster has been held up awaiting parts but will soon be back gracing the sky around Ardmore.
