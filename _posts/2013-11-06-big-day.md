It has been a big day today with a low power engine run on P40 CAG post engine change and currently high powers happening on Strikemaster 70 post 100 hr annual and repairs.

Marty now has about 3 days worth of paperwork to do tomorrow and then it will be all go.

The Strikemaster has been held up awaiting parts but will soon be back gracing the sky around Ardmore.
