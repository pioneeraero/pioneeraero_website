It has been a busy couple of weeks with a lot of visitors through the shop.

Yesterday we received a consignment of items for the T51 including the engine (3.5 litre V6 ) prop and the larger undercarriage legs. Check out these photos on the T51 page.

On the Tempest we are now pulling the entire forward section of the fuselage to pieces, once it has been cleaned/checked it will be painted silver before reassembly. The RH wing is now fully secure in the jig and work has started on its restoration.

We also have on its way this week a crate of sheet aluminium which we have purchased in the UK, all we need now is rivets and hardware!
