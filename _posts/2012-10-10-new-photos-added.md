It has been a busy couple of weeks with a lot of visitors through the shop.

Yesterday, we received a consignment of items for the T51 including the engine (3.5 Litre V6 ) prop and the larger undercarriage legs. Check out these photos on the [T51 page](]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }})).

On the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}), we are now pulling the entire forward section of the fuselage to pieces. Once it has been cleaned/checked it will be painted silver before reassembly. 
The right-hand wing is now fully secure in the jig and work has started on its restoration.

We also have on its way this week a crate of sheet aluminium which we have purchased in the UK. All we need now is rivets and hardware!
