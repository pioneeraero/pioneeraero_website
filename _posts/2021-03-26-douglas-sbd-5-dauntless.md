Pioneer Aero are very proud to be asked by The Fighter Factory and Military Aviation Museum to carry out the restoration of the SBD-5 Dauntless B-22 Serial Number 36175. To be involved with this iconic aircraft is a big honour. We feel that the relationship that was forged between The Fighter Factory and Military Aviation Museum and Pioneer Aero Ltd with the restoration of the P-39 Airacobra was very positive and remains so to this day. This was demonstrated by Tom Kurtz III asking us if we wished to take on this restoration.

The SBD was the the principal American dive bomber from its introduction in 1940 through to its replacement by the SB2C Helldiver in mid 1944 and is best remembered for delivering the fatal blows to the four Japanese fleet carriers in the battle of Midway, June 1942. Perhaps lesser known is that in July 1943 No 25 Squadron RNZAF was formed at Seagrove flying SBD-3 aircraft obtained from the American Forces. The long abandoned RNZAF Station Seagrove is a short drive from our hangar at Ardmore , South Auckland.

Follow this journey as it unfolds.
