Lots has happened since the last post: Staggerwing is now flying; the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}) project moves on, as does the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}). 

The Strikemaster has had the control surfaces and fin painted, and is going back together in time for [Classic Fighters](https://www.classicfighters.co.nz/) this weekend.

[Strikemaster 72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) starts the journey back home next month.
