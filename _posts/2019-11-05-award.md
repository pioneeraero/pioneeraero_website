Last Friday we were honoured to receive an award from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Aeronautical Society. The award recognises the work done by the entire team at Pioneer Aero for their work on the Bell P39 Airacobra aircraft for Jerry Yagen and other historically significant aircraft. We would like to thank the Royal Aeronautical Society for this award and again acknowledge our great team here and their contribution.
