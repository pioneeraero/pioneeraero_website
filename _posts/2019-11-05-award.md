Last Friday, we were honoured to receive an award from the [New Zealand Division of the Royal Aeronautical Society](https://www.aerosociety.com/get-involved/branches-divisions/divisions/new-zealand-division/).

The award recognises the work done by the entire team at Pioneer Aero for their work on the [Bell P-39 Airacobra]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) aircraft for Jerry Yagen and other historically significant aircraft.

We would like to thank the [Royal Aeronautical Society](https://www.aerosociety.com/) for this award, and again acknowledge our great team here and their contribution.
