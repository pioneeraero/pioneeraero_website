Well, it has been a little over a week since we got our new website up and running, and we are pleased with its progress. Still a lot of updating to go on but a good start. 

In the hangar this week, work has been carrying on with all of the current projects: manufacture of fuselage skins for the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}), final assembly of the P-40E tailplane, and initial inspections being carried out on the [Tempest]({{ '/projects/hawker-tempest-mkii' | relative_url }}) fuselage and wings.

[Pauline]({{ '/staff/pauline-de-graaf' | relative_url }}) from our office has had a knee restoration take place this week, we wish her a speedy recovery and hope she is back on deck before PAYE day.

Also just passing the door this week, we have had the Venom coming out of the [Airspray](https://www.facebook.com/people/Airspray-Ardmore-Ltd/100054587072528/) paintshop and the Mosquito heading in, who would work in town!
