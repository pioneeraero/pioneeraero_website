Well it has been a little over a week since we got our new website up and running and we are pleased with its progress, still a lot of updating to go on but a good start. In the hangar this week work has been carrying on with all of the current projects, manufacture of fuselage skins for the T51, final assembly of the P-40E tailplane and initial inspections being carried out on the Tempest fuselage and wings.

Pauline from our office has had a knee restoration take place this week, we wish her a speedy recovery and hope she is back on deck before PAYE day.

Also just passing the door this week we have had the Venom coming out of the Airspray paintshop and the Mosquito heading in, who would work in town!
