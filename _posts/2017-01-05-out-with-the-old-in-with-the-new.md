Year that is.

Hangar is full and ready for the Staff to arrive next week. On the servicing front, we finished off last year working on Jets with the 3 Strikemasters all servicable and ready for the up coming airshows. We Start this year finishing off the P40 and Mustang annuals.

On the restorations side all of the new wing fittings for the P39 have been drilled with just a couple of them needing to have the spotfacing finished. All of the fuel tanks have been templated so we can get them manufactured (rubber bags) and good progress has been made working through the wings and flight controls.

The P40’s are progressing well with fuselage #3 sitting in a wheel around stand and now ready for some attention.

All said we are looking for a big year.

I **met** a kiwi tabby cat  
He **has** the name of Curtis  
He **lives** amongst the aeroplanes  
and **sleeps** on any surface.

He **has** an entire hangar and  
the **people** who work in it,  
and **if** you’d like, he’s happy to  
be **petted** for a minute.

At **night** he prowls the airplane cowls  
and **hunts** efficiently.  
His **is** a life of leisure and  
of **self**-sufficiency.
