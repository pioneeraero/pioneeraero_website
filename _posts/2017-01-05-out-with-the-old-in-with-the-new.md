Year that is.

Hangar is full and ready for the staff to arrive next week.  
On the servicing front, we finished off last year working on jets with the [three]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) [Strikemasters]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) [all]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) serviceable and ready for the up-coming airshows.  
We start this year finishing off the P-40 and [Mustang]({{ '/projects/mustang-p-51d' | relative_url }}) annuals.

On the restorations side, all of the new wing fittings for the [P-39]({{ '/projects/bell-p-39f-1-be-airacobra' | relative_url }}) have been drilled, with just a couple of them needing to have the spotfacing finished.  
All of the fuel tanks have been templated so we can get them manufactured (rubber bags), and good progress has been made working through the wings and flight controls.

The P-40s are progressing well, with fuselage #3 sitting in a wheel-around stand and now ready for some attention.

All said, we are looking for a big year.

I **met** a kiwi tabby cat  
He **has** the name of Curtis  
He **lives** amongst the aeroplanes  
and **sleeps** on any surface.

He **has** an entire hangar and  
the **people** who work in it,  
and **if** you’d like, he’s happy to  
be **petted** for a minute.

At **night** he prowls the airplane cowls  
and **hunts** efficiently.  
His **is** a life of leisure and  
of **self**-sufficiency.
