A big congratulations for all involved with the Strikemaster ltd deployment to Wanaka. 25 rides in the Strikemaster and 15 in the P51 over 3 flying days is a huge achievement. Also worth noting that the Strikemaster on 2 of the days carried out 10 flights this could well be some sort of record for this aircraft type.
