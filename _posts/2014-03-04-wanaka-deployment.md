A big congratulations for all involved with the [Strikemaster]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) ltd deployment to Wanaka. 25 rides in the Strikemaster and 15 in the [P-51]({{ '/projects/mustang-p-51d' | relative_url }}) over 3 flying days is a huge achievement. 

Also worth noting that the Strikemaster on 2 of the days carried out 10 flights. This could well be some sort of record for this aircraft type.
