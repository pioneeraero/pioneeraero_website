One of the difficulties keeping the Warbird aircraft flying is finding components that can be overhauled. The P40 brakes are an area were the pool of restorable items has started to dry up, especially the brake drums which have a tendency to crack or go out of round.

To fix this problem we have comissioned a run of new cast steel drake drums, pictured is one of the first lot of castings which is now being machined.

If you know of anyone who may want a set or more of these please get them to contact us.
