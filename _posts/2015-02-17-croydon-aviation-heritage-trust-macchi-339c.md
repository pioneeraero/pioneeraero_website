Last week, with assistance from Colin Smith and his team from [Croydon Aircraft](https://www.croydonaviation.co.nz/), Pioneer Aero assembled the ex-RNZAF Macchi 339c, 75, to go on display in the Trust’s fine hangar at Mandeville, just north of Gore.

We are pleased to report that all went well and the aircraft is now on display. The only real casualties were the teams' waistlines as they suffered from four days of fine southern hospitality.

Thanks and best wishes to Colin, Maeva and the rest of the crew.
