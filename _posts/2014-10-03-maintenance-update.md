The repairs to the P-40 CAG fuselage are all but completed - the coolers have been removed for repairs and the 100hr annual servicing is about to commence.

It is all go with the Strikemaster fleet this month: 

[72]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-72' | relative_url }}) has been having some hydraulic system components serviced and is now ready to take to the air again. 

[70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}) is in the hangar for its annual servicing, and [62]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-62' | relative_url }}) is now awaiting certification from CAA so it can begin its test flight program. 

A three-ship is a possibility before Christmas.
