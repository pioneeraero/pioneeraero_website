Yesterday was a significant day in the restoration of [P-40E S#41-13570]({{ '/projects/curtiss-p-40e-kittyhawk-s-41-13570' | relative_url }}) with the wings and fuselage being mated.  
A great way to mark the end of our Covid-19 lockdown.

Thanks must go to the whole team for getting to this milestone. Thanks also to Mark from [On Call Cranes](https://www.oncallcranes.co.nz/) for his expertise with the lifting.  
Below are a few photos from yesterday. More catch-up photos will be posted to the [project page]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}) over the next few days.
