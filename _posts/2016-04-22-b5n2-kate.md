Well the word seems to be out now well and truly, Pacific Aviation Museum in Hawaii have unveiled the remains of the “Kate” that was surrendered to the RNZAF at Jacquinot Bay at the end of WWII.

It is fitting that this aircraft should find a home at the Museum at Pearl Harbour, Pioneer Aero are proud to have had a hand in this acquisition and after carrying out preservation work and preparing some smaller parts for display are looking forward to continuing with the restoration.
