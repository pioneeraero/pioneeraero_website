Well, the word seems to be out now, well and truly: [Pacific Aviation Museum](https://www.pacificaviationmuseum.org/) in Hawaii have unveiled the remains of the “Kate” that was surrendered to the RNZAF at Jacquinot Bay at the end of WWII.

It is fitting that this aircraft should find a home at the Museum at Pearl Harbour. 

Pioneer Aero are proud to have had a hand in this acquisition, and after carrying out preservation work and preparing some smaller parts for display, are looking forward to continuing with the restoration.
