Just some additions and minor change to the website, the main one being the addition of a Current Maintenance in the [projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}). We thought there maybe some interest in this. 

We are currently working on the P-51 TAF, and coming up maintenance work and annuals on the P-40 CAG and [Strikemaster 70]({{ '/projects/strikemaster-70' | relative_url }}). Photos of this to follow.

There have also been some additional photos added to both the [T51]({{ '/projects/titan-t51' | relative_url }}) and P-40E pages.
