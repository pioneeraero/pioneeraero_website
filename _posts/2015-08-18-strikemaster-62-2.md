The best laid plans!! We had intended to carry out the annual servicing on Strikemaster 72 in New Zealand Warbirds hangar starting early September. However 62 had the last say and last week decided to drop all of the fluid out of itâ€™s LH main leg so in conjunction with sorting this problem the annual on 62 has also started. A different aircraft and a couple of weeks early but something dynamic happening in the Warbirds hangar for the next week or so in the Jet corner.
