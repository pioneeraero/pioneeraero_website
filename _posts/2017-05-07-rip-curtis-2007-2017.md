After months of on going health problems and continuing weight loss the difficult decision was made to put the once feisty hangar cat to rest. It seemed strange to walk into the hangar this morning and not get tripped up by one cat demanding food.

He will be missed but we could not stand to see the daily deterioration in his condition.

Thanks to Trevor for taking the unpleasant trip to the vets.
