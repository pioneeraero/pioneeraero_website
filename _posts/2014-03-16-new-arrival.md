On Friday, we hosted all of the owners of New Zealandâ€™s flying Strikemaster jet fleet.

And at 8:00am Monday morning, the latest acquisition, NZ6362, hit the ground at Ardmore. Hopefully by the end of the day, I will be able to post a photo of the 3 ex-RNZAF jets together.

NZCAA due here on Wednesday to certify NZ6372. We move ever closer to a multi-Strikemaster photo shoot.
