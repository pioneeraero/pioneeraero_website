It has been a busy month, the annual servicing on Strikemaster 62 has been completed and the annual on CAG is almost done. Both of these have been carried out in the back of the New Zealand Warbirds main hangar which has added a dynamic element to what has largely been a storage shed. We have had alot of positive comments on this and there have certainly been a large amount of photos taken, people have been fasinated seeing the aircraft with their clothes off.

Also arriving in the hangar last week was P40E 41-13570 which has come in from the USA, this project will be rebuilt to fly with a rear seat and dual controls.

Photos have been added to the current maintanence and P40 project.
